Fennec bootstrapper

What it is:
This extension allows you to dynamically load chrome code in
mobile/android/chrome/content/ from a remote location. This means you don't
need to rebuild to try your changes.

How it works:
When you install the extension, you provide a URL containing:
  * A content/ directory; this can be pulled directly from your
    mobile/android/chrome source directory.
  * A replace.json file; this contains regex replacements used when the
    bootstrapped scripts are executed. These remove preprocessing directives,
    replace chrome:// URLs, and do other replacements necessary for running
    these scripts without having to modify them directly.

How to use it:
1) Download the extension: http://people.mozilla.com/~bnicholson/bootstrapper.xpi
